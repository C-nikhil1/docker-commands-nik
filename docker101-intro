Docker engine is a virtulization layer over which containers created using the image and run.

Container is independent of the OS. This is the reason any application can run on any OS using container. However to run the container docker engine should be installed on host OS.

There are three things reuqired to run the container.

1. Docker file - Using this we can form a image with require dependecies
2. Docker images - Using this we can create a container
3. Container - This is light weight OS where application can run independently

Docker Daemon - This is the background process which keeps the track of images, containers.
